azove was developed with g++ 4.1.2.

If you are working on a Linux machine just type
make
and it should compile fine.
You might have a look at the Makefile for changing some compile options.
Memory usage can be adjusted in the file azove.cpp.
In case your machine provides /proc/meminfo (today all Linux kernels should do so)
change the defined value LEFTOVER_FREE_MEMORY to your needs,
otherwise play with the value FIXED_MDDNODEBASESIZE to adjust the memory consumption.

azove accepts input files in the .ine format (H-representation) which is used by tools
like lrs and cdd. A file format description can be found in the user guides
of lrs and cdd or here
